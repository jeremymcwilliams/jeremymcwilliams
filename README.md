### Jeremy McWilliams
Head of Digital Services<br>
Watzek Library<br>
Lewis & Clark College<br>
Portland, OR, USA

I manage library systems at Watzek Library, including Alma/Primo, EZProxy, LibGuides, and Omeka. I also write AngularJS customizations for ExLibris's Primo catalog, and build software to improve staff workflows and connect systems, and preserve our digital collections.

Outside the library, I help teach web development (PHP, MySQL, CSS, Javascript) and Data Science (R, Python) at Lewis & Clark.
